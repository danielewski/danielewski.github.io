<h3>About Me </h3>
<p>I am a Senior at the University of Denver, finishing up my Bachelors in Applied Computing, in addition to my minors in Physics and Communications.</p>
<p>When I started at DU, I had thought that I would graduate with a degree in Finance. However, after taking Honors Intro to CS in my first quarter, I knew that I truly wanted to follow the computer science path.</p>
<p>When I am not working on classwork or for Bloomtime, I tend to gravitate towards skiing in the rockies, going out with my friends, or watching videos on youtube that spike my interests.</p>

<h3>Hell yeah brother</h3>
