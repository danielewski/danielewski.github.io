                <h3>About Me </h3>
                <p>I am a Senior at the University of Denver, finishing up my Bachelors in Applied Computing, in
                    addition
                    to my
                    minors in Physics and Communications.</p>
                <p>When I started at DU, I had thought that I would graduate with a degree in Finance. However, after
                    taking
                    Honors Intro to CS in my first quarter, I knew that I truly wanted to follow the computer science
                    path.</p>
                <p>When I am not working on classwork or for Bloomtime, I tend to gravitate towards skiing in the
                    rockies, hanging out with my friends, or watching videos that spark my interest!
